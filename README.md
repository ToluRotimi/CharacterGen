# QA - DEVOPS - PRACTICAL PROJECT
## Author - Tolu Rotimi
## Objective
* To create a application fully integrated using the Feature-Branch model into a Version Control System which will subsequently be built through a CI server and deployed to a cloud-based virtual machine.
### Brief Outline
* The application will generata a random colour and personality and display to the user a personality associated from both.

## Services
* Service 1(Frontend)
  * This service is the user-interface
  * This sends requests to the other services and displays the personality generated 
* Service 2
  * This service recieved a HTTP Get request from service 1 and carries out the function to generate a random  
    object(colour).

* Service 3
  * This service recieved a HTTP Get request from service 1 and carries out the function to generate a random  
    object(personlaity).

* Service 4
  * This service recieved a HTTP POST request from service 1 and carries out the the function to pick out the character generated using the get requests from service 2 and 3 and display that to the use.

## Initial Planning with Designs and Tracking

###  **User Stories+Acceptance Criteria**
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/96881229/183012070-66efecc0-3ee1-4132-b8fb-40865a9755e0.png)

Intially planned on creating an additon section where the user inputted personlaity traits to access a charcacter that was suit their personality but needed to work within the timescale so I removed that section of the project but you'll see in my User Story and Acceptance Criteria how that would have played out. Overall my new aim as I progressed with the project was keep as simple as possible but remain as functional as possible.  

### **Trello Board** 
I used Trello board to act as a visual for my product backlog. It helped act as a guide as to the next steps to take and what to prioritise by adjusting the different cards.

Beginning of the project

End of Project

### **Risk Assessment**
Risk Assessement using excel showing the potential threats to the project. Encountered new potential threats as I progressed in the project and updated as I went along.

### **ERD**
Entity relationship diagram. 
Initial ERD

![Barbie-Era ERD](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/96881229/183014548-256225b6-2c7a-4442-adfe-0b0310af6c78.jpg)

Final ERD
The initial didn't adhere to best practices and was over complicated so I created 3 tables. 2 tables being the user and barbie_era table with a one to many relationship and with the user_id as a foreignkey. Then related the two main tables to a join table where both id's were used as a foreign key. 

![Untitled Diagram](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/96881229/183014924-d9f7074b-a173-45cb-9b4f-ed36872d98ee.jpg)

The aim for doing this was that an already established user in the database could just have their user_id already in the barbie_era so all they needed to do was pick their birth year to calculate what barbie era they were born. 

### **Front End**

Frontend aplication done using flask and HTML

Create Functionality 
 
 The user inputs their forename and surname and then the barbie era picks up that user and asks for their birth year
 The user is then taken to a url where it prints out the barbie era they were born in

Python code
 
The python code was created utilising the if statements to print out the barbie year that matched with user.

Done using sqlalchjemy(ORM) to interact with the database but without needing to manually go to the database.

### **Testing**

* Unit Testing

Get Request

Tested using Pytest - Command Line : python3 -m pytest and python3 -m pytest --cov=application

 The aim was to essentially test for the crud part of the application and and see that it comes back successful
 * Test for view users to see that entry had been successful in the application
 * Test for get_user_era to see that the python calculation was succesful and it displays the right message
 * Test to see that the added entry for add user and add barbie era has been added to the application
 * Test to see the that for the update user or barbie era gets updated and is successful 
 
Post Request

 The aim of post request is to ensure that in relation to the forms displayed for the add and update functionalites
 It gets posted into the application and comes back successful.

Integration Testing 

Tested using Selenium

The aim of integration testion is to insert fake entries into fields and it is then passed unto the frontend and
then integrated with the backend to come back successful.

* testing for fields of barbie year , birth year and user on the

Setup Complete
 
 ### **Future**
 * Test for validators to lead to more coverage
 * Create jobs in jenkins to run automated tests 
 * Add in a nav bar to create a better user interface to make it more accessible to the user
